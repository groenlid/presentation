Ember 
-----

Quick intro to ember:
-----
* Javascript MVC framework
* More productive out of the box
* A very opinionated framework
	- Naming conventions:
		- User route -> looks for UserController, UserView, User template.
* Requires very little code to get up and running.
* URL driven router -> statemanager

* Automatic stubbing of controllers/views/routes if you don't create them.

Ember core consepts

----

One Ember.Router
* Takes the url and sets up the apropriate

-----

Big data
	- OData
	- Don't fetch data that hasn't changed twice.

Big users... eh.. userbase
	- Send as small json files as possible
		- Gzip
		- Transform json
		- Send partial json

Big codebase
- Make small components
- Lazy load part of the application-code
- Browser cache - images, localized-strings, localstorage, websql
- Make smaller projects with some common code.
	- Do everything need to be a spa?
- idiomatic.js
	- Have coding standards, preferably enforced by jshint.
- Minify code and split into chunks based on what users normally do
	- CDN javascript.
		- Azure CRN.

Complex views
- Chrome inspector is your friend (also Ember Inspector)
	- Cpu profiling
	- FPS meter + Enable continous page repainting.
Support for ipad, phones etc
- Rendering performance
	- 60 hz = rendering each 16-17ms
- Render big lists, only render what's in viewport.
- Ember's using string templates instead of DOM-based (angular).
	- Server side compiling.
- Ember Run Loop
	- One render each loop.
- Precompile handlebars templates
- Small devices does not like big data....
	- OData
	- Fetch data on demand

- Keep debugging when the application is in production
	- Raven -> Sentry
		- Source-maps
	- NewRelic


- Grunt is slow.....
	- grunt-concurrent
	- grunt-newer -> imagemin
	- only have one grunt-file
	- time-grunt to analyze

Test test test test..... *whispers* test...
	- Selenium
	- SpaceMonkey
	- Protractor
	- https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul
	- https://github.com/marmelab/gremlins.js
	- testem
	- grunt-phantomas
		- Can test how well your site loads over time

Ember pros
-----

Handlebars restricts you to write testable code... No "expressions"/"logic" in the templates.
Convention over configuration
	- Eg naming
		- PersonController.js
		- PersonView.js
		- Person.handlebars
	- Restricts "the one" developer that always gets "creative" with classnames.
	- Ember components adhere to the W3C's web components draft.
	- Ember core team always tries to future proof your application.

Ember polyfills ES5 (and ES6) functionality.
	- forEach, map, reduce and filter oh my..
	Ember.RSVP.promise...

Ember's router.
	#- The best there is...
		#- Allows nesting n-deep routes while preserving state in each layer.
		#	- together with {{link-to}}
	- Url driven approach.

-----

// Ember
Router.map(function(){
   this.route(‘foobar’);
});

// Link to foobar in handlebars
{{#link-to 'foobar' model}}linky{{/link}}
Automatic data-flow.
route -> controller -> view -> template

------

// Angular
$routeProvider.when(‘/foobar’, {
   templateUrl: ‘/templates/foobar.html’,
   controller: ‘FoobarController’
});


------

Handlebars
<!-- but this is what we have to do in Ember today -->
<div {{bind-attr class="foo"}}>{{bar}}</div>

HTMLBars
<!-- With HTMLBars, we get our ideal syntax! -->
<div class="{{foo}}">{{bar}}</div>
